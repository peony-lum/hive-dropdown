# Hive Frontend Challenge
Hi! Thank you for the challenge and thank you for taking a look at my code!

## Instructions
I decided to build out the dropdown component with vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS. My files are all located within the root directory.

### Viewing the Demo/Dropdown component
To view the final product, you can navigate to the dropdown.html file and there you should see two dropdown components. One being the multi select dropdown and one being the single select dropdown.
It should look something like this:
<img width="1552" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 3 40 45â€¯AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13435f7d-e2d2-4192-8623-9e95180aca3d" />

The two dropdown components have options that I have already passed in (for the sake of demo), but feel free to alter the code within the dropdown.html file.

### Dropdown Component Props
The `options` prop/attribute takes in a comma separated string with all of the options that should be included within the dropdown menu.

The `selecttype` prop/attribute takes in a string of either "multi-select" to indicate a multi select dropdown, otherwise it will treat it as a single select dropdown.

That should be it, but please feel free to reach out to me if there is anything else I can help clarify. Thank you!
